# HaskellCheckers
There are two folders one called test moves with script and the other one is called to test apply_move <br />
	
	- test moves with script contains 
		- GameStructures.hs
		- Moves.hs (which has moves and apply_move also imports GameStructures so you can test the script)
	
	- to test apply_move contains 
		- Main.hs (where it imports Moves so you can run checkers to test apply_move)
		- Moves.hs (which has moves and apply_move also this version imports GameLogic)
